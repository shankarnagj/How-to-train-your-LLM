# 🦜 How to Train Your LLM

> A practical, playful guide to building and fine-tuning your own Large Language Models — from data to deployment.

🦜 **Why the Parrot?**  
The parrot represents the idea of LLMs as **"stochastic parrots"** — models that mimic human language by statistically predicting the next word based on patterns. Like parrots, LLMs don’t "understand" language but are amazing at repeating and remixing it — if trained well!

## 🎯 What This Repo Covers

This repository walks you through the **entire journey of training your own LLM**, organized in beginner-friendly, modular notebooks and markdowns:

- ✅ **Introduction to LLMs** – What they are, why we train them
- 📦 **Data Collection** – Sourcing and cleaning textual data
- 🔤 **Tokenization** – Byte-Level BPE, WordPiece, Unigram LM
- 🧠 **Pretraining a Transformer** – Building and training from scratch
- 🛠️ **Fine-tuning** – Using LoRA, QLoRA, PEFT for specific tasks
- 📊 **Evaluation & Safety** – Testing, hallucination detection, guardrails
- 🚀 **Deployment** – Serving LLMs locally and in the cloud
- 🧩 **Agents & RAG** – Making your LLMs tool-using and context-aware

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Python, PyTorch
- HuggingFace Transformers, Datasets
- PEFT, LoRA, QLoRA
- LangChain / CrewAI

## 📌 Inspired By

🎥 Just like *"How to Train Your Dragon"*, this repo is about taming something powerful. LLMs are the new dragons — they breathe fire (tokens), need guidance (data), and can either be dangerous or delightful based on how you train them.
